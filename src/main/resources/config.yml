#This section is for commands that should be
#forwarded to all other servers in the network.
#All forwarded commands check for the specified permission
#node on the calling player to determine whether the player
#has access to that command or not.
#If you would like a command to be forwarded for everyone
#by default, just make it require the permission node
#xserver.message.send
#If you wish to have commands that require parameters,
#it would be best to put a space after the command name
#so when the command is entered without parameters it does
#not get forwarded to the other servers.
#These commands are issued as if they were typed into the
#server console.
#format is:
#  command: permission.node
#forwardedCommands:
#  'whitelist ': minecraft.command.whitelist
#  'op ': minecraft.command.op
#  'deop ': minecraft.command.deop
