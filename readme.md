Build Info
----------
The plugin is built with Maven, use `mvn clean install` in the main directory to build.
You can find the final JAR in the `target` directory.

The dedicated server is written in Go, so you'll need some sort of Go toolchain installed and working.
If you're using the official toolchain, build the server by running `go build` in the `xserverd` directory.
